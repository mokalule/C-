Virtual Robot to Adjust AC Based on Room Temperature
Description

This C++ program simulates a virtual robot that monitors the room temperature and adjusts the AC accordingly. The robot takes user input for the current room temperature and compares it to a user-defined desired temperature. Based on the comparison, the robot either turns the AC on (if it's too hot) or leaves it off (if the room is cool enough).
Features

    The program takes the current room temperature as input.
    The robot adjusts the AC based on the comparison between the current temperature and the desired temperature.
    It displays the AC status and the temperatures.

Usage
Compilation

    Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
    Compile the code using g++:

How It Works

    Take Input: The program asks for the desired room temperature and then the current room temperature.
    Adjust AC: If the current temperature is higher than the desired temperature, the AC is turned ON. Otherwise, it's turned OFF.
    Display Status: The program shows the current room temperature, the desired temperature, and whether the AC is ON or OFF.

Requirements

    C++ Compiler (such as g++)
    Terminal or command-line environment
